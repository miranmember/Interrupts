# Interrupts
This project involves using interrupts to control the behavior of an Arduino program. Two buttons are attached to the Arduino, and each button triggers a different interrupt. When the first button is pressed, it stops a timer that is displayed on an LCD panel and shows a message stating that the timer was interrupted. When the second button is pressed, it resets the timer and the program continues as before.
